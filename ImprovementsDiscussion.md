## Introduction ##
This page is to discuss what might be improved for future versions.
I'm specifically interested in
  1. Verbs that need added, to rotate on
  1. Whether the algorithm should prefer verbs towards the beginning or end of the sentence (currently prefers end) or other algorithm ideas
  1. Sentences you have run across that came out really weird and un-Yoda-like
and of course any other comments you have are welcome as well. Have at it.
