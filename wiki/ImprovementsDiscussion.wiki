This page is to discuss what might be improved for future versions.
I'm specifically interested in
  # Verbs that should be rotated on
  # Whether the algorithm should prefer verbs towards the beginning or end of the sentence (currently prefers end) or other algorithm ideas
  # Sentences you have run across that came out really weird and un-Yoda-like
and of course any other comments you have are welcome as well. Have at it.
