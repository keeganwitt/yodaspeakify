## Overview ##
This bot converts all text in a wave into Yodaspeak.

## Known issues ##
This code is considered alpha quality. It has quirks.
  1. Translation sometimes yields strange results.
  1. Bot doesn't respect letter casing.
  1. Occasionally slow or doesn't translate at all. I'm still investigating this issue, I believe it to be a problem with Wave or possibly the app engine itself.
  1. The bot currently only rotates on some 300 verbs, obviously more need to be added, possibly with other tenses (not sure what will work best). This is visible when blips are modified by Yodaspeakify but without any visible changes.
